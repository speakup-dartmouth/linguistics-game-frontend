# ðŸ—£ Linguistics Games Frontend

Linguistics Games, a.k.a. Speak Up, is an innovative gameified mobile app that invites users to play via voice-controlled mechanisms. They can choose a stance to respond to a variety of questions, as well as upvote and downvote other users' posts. With the user's consent, these voice samples are anonymized aggregated and together to form large-scale datasets, with whole new magnitudes of `N > 10,000`. The aim of this app is to empower every researcher with larger and more comprehensive datasets for richer hypotheses, and in particular cutting-edge sociolinguistic analysis. Ultimately, the impact of this app can stretch far beyond linguistics. Other fields like economics, sociology, anthropology all experience the same challenge of small sample sizes. This technique can inspire similar approaches in these other fields, and usher in a new era of computational research.

## Designs
